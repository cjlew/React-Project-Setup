# React-Project-Setup
A guide to setting up a standard React project

### Intro

So you haven't worked with React in awhile, or ever, and are looking for a guide? Say no more.

This guide will show you how to set up a basic React project using npm (a package manager) with ES6, babel (a compiler) and webpack (a bundler)

### Step 1: Setup Some Folders and Files

Open your terminal and create the directory

`mkdir MyProject`

Enter the directory 

`cd MyProject`

Create a `lib`, and `stylesheets` folder

`mkdir lib stylesheets`

Within the `lib` folder create your `app.js`

`touch app.js`
